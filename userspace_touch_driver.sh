# WARNING: THIS IS NOT FOR REGULAR USERS. It's for low level hackers who want to talk
#          directly with the hardware over I2C, using unsupported commands which may
#          change between display batches. I also have no clue about proper timing or
#          how to ensure that a touch events coordinates (16 bits) are read out in a
#          latched manner, and I have no control over hardware reset of the display,
#          so I have no way to recover from certain error conditions.
#            Additionally, it might be possible to brick the display controller in
#          mysterious ways by changing default values (if they are stored
#          permanently), so use this at your own risk.
#
# HW configuration:
#          The display is attached to a Raspberry Pi 3 using the standard display cable.
#          Since there currently is no way to talk to it directly on a raspberry pi 3
#          (except if you are the GPU), a few changes was needed:
#          * The I2C lines from the display is additionally attached to the i2c-1 bus.
#          * The I2C-1 bus is enabled in /boot/config.txt by adding this line:
#            dtparam=i2c_arm=on
#          * The touch panel is disabled in /boot/config.txt (only way to get the GPU to
#            stop talking constantly to it without cutting traces on the board). This
#            line was added to /boot/config.txt:
#            disable_touchscreen=1
#
# Misc notes:
#          During system bootup, there is still quite a lot of traffic on that I2C bus,
#          but once the system is up and running, the bus seems to be quiet.
#

#            identical to the registers in the raspberry pi (for instance going into the
